1.	Index on the coupon IsActive flag column to get active coupon. 
2.	Partition on table CouponRedemptions based on the date. 
3.	Archiving the historical data of CouponRedemption. 
4.	Create views which are easier to query, such as to check whether a user can redeem a coupon, it need to check whether the coupon is active or not, has the user has the coupon, has the user exceeds the max number allowed.  Create a view across multiple table to cater the requirement rather than query across multiple tables. It should be relevant easier and faster than query across all the tables. 
5.	Create a separate table for reporting purpose. The report schema should be fixed. Populate the report table daily/hourly based on the schema. When report is requested, it will only run against reporting table rather than the big table CouponRedemptions to offload the work from the big table.
