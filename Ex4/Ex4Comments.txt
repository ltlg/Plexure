1)No interface defined. Hard to write Unit test
2)Constructor: dependency injection violation - should pass SqlAgentStore and GoogleMapsDistanceCalculator as parameters rather than initialize them from constructor
3) CalculateAirlinePrices
       - _dataStore.GetItinaryAsync(itineraryId).Result block the thread. it will cause deadlock.
	    should use await and change return type to 
	   - List<Quote> is not thread safe. change it to Use ConcurrentBag
4)CalculateTotalTravelDistanceAsync
       - _distanceCalculator.GetDistanceAsync(itinerary.Waypoints[i],
                 itinerary.Waypoints[i + 1]).Result; block current thread causing deadlock
				 use await instead 
5) FindAgent
        - has noting to do with ItineraryManager. It should bring to Agent class
		- FindAgent does two thing in one method. It should split into two: FindAgent and UpdateAgentPhoneNumber
